# Space Zoologist - California Education Learning Lab (CELL) Project
## Project Summary
Space Zoologist is a video game that will teach engineering students needs-finding, designing, and researching skills. It is in the design and development process and will be developed through 2019-2020 school year. In the game, the player will take on the role of a space zoologist that is tasked with restoring the populations of various animal species whose home planet was destroyed. With only partial data on the animals' native environments, the player will have to pay close attention to the needs and behaviors of the animals as well as make the most of the given data. 

## Overall
This is a section of the project that handles the food sources in general, including food production, food environment interaction, and calculations.

## Food Production

## Food Environment Interactions

## Calculation
Conditions: Bad = 0, Moderate = 1, Good = 2

FinalOutput = (BaseOutput)\*(Condition)\*(Weight/TotalWeight)
